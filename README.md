Blockchain-enabled group membership management implemented in Powershell


This is an example partial implementation of a blockchain-secured group membership assignment system.  
This example does these things:
  *Creates a blockchain
  *Adds 1000 Base64-encoded JSON objects to the blockchain
  *Verifies the blockchain's integrity
  *Decodes the verified data
  *Parses the data back into objects ready for further processing

 The main point of the example is to show how easy it is to secure data in this manner, and how simply
 it could be applied to Access Management.  It is presently missing the components necessary to secure the writes
 and implement the results against a directory, among other things.

 Compatibility:
  *Windows
  *MacOS
